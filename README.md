# ScryFetcher README.md
A script to retrieve bulk data from scryfall.com via their API and then writing it in a csv file.
## Current version: v1.1.3

## Usage for v1.1.3 and further:
1. Make sure you have the newest version of Python 3 installed (tested on python 3.11)
2. Run scrywrite.py in the command line: >python .\scrywrite.py
3. After it finishes executing, scryfallbulk.csv now contains the requested values

### Dislcaimer: At the current stage the csv will only be filled if there are matching values in the specified columns during the loop. For now this is unique to what I have in my database.

For 2.0 I will add a database writing functionality as well as an executable for ease of use
